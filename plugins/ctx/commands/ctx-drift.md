# /ctx:drift — Cross-Document Drift Detection

Find contradictions, gaps, and inconsistencies between AI context files from different tool ecosystems.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS`

- **No arguments**: discover all context files, then compare every pair.
- **File paths** (e.g., `/ctx:drift CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md AGENTS.md`): compare only the named files against each other. At least two files are needed for a meaningful comparison.
- **Ecosystem names** (e.g., `/ctx:drift claude-code cursor`): compare all context files belonging to those ecosystems.
- **Single file** (e.g., `/ctx:drift CLAUDE.md`): compare that file against every other discovered context file to find where it disagrees.

## Instructions

First, identify all memory and instruction files in the repo (run discovery if needed). If the user provided arguments above, restrict comparison to the specified files or ecosystems. Then compare them against each other.

### Comparison process

For each pair of context files that describe the same project:

**1. Identify shared topics.** Do both files discuss: project architecture? Dependencies? Build commands? Directory structure? Language support? Deployment targets? Testing approach?

**2. Compare factual claims on shared topics.**
- Version numbers: do they cite the same versions?
- Architecture descriptions: do they describe the same patterns?
- Technology references: do they name the same tools/frameworks?
- Path references: do they point to the same locations?
- Command references: do they list the same commands?

**3. Flag contradictions.** Where file A explicitly says X and file B explicitly says Y about the same thing. Include both quotes and explain the conflict.

**4. Flag gaps.** Where file A covers a significant topic (a core dependency, a major architectural decision, a deployment model) that file B omits entirely. This usually means file B predates a change. Note which file is likely more current based on modification dates and content depth.

### Also check for

**Orphaned planning docs**: Files in output directories (claudedocs/, plans/, etc.) that:
- Reference phases or milestones that have been superseded
- Contain "COMPLETE" in the filename but describe work that may have been revised since
- Are more than 30 days old and reference specific implementation details

**Symlink freshness**: If GEMINI.md symlinks to CLAUDE.md (or similar), note that they share content. If they DON'T symlink but probably should (identical or near-identical content), flag that too.

**Constitution/governance drift**: If a governance document exists (like a project constitution), check whether memory files align with its stated principles or reference outdated versions.

### Output

Report contradictions and drift warnings individually, with:
- The specific files involved
- The topic of disagreement
- Quotes from each file
- Which is likely correct (based on recency, specificity, or code evidence)
- Recommended resolution

End with a summary: total contradictions, total drift warnings, orphaned doc count.
